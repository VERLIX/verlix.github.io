### New Projects
New from VERLIX, VERLIX Assistant, is going to be a virtual assistant designed for the casual use desktop computer. When you need him, when you want him. We want to design VERLIX Assistant unlike any other, therefore, this project will take quite a while.

V.A. planning markdown

# Ideas

1. Add a main program, where you can edit the settings and such
2. Add a secondary program, in which the virtual assistant will be housed

## General Plan
** Create a virtual assistant designed to help the everyday user
```
